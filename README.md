# IEE Special Topics in Computer Aided Design
## Class Intro.
* Instructor: 劉建男
* Prerequisites: C++, Introduction to digital systems and VLSI design
* Course descriptions and objectives:

    Computer-aided design (CAD) techniques are essential for modern complex designs. In this course, the CAD techniques for the synthesis and verification of VLSI designs are introduced. Besides using those CAD tools, our focus is the insight techniques and algorithms to develop the synthesis and verification tools. These contents are important background knowledge to do the related researches. For those students whose research directions are not CAD-related topics, better understanding of CAD tools also helps to use those tools better.
